# Bulk-RNA PSCs - Functional Enrichment

This capsule contains the functional enrichment analysis conducted on the 
bulk RNA-seq PSCs from 
[Mucciolo et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2023.12.002) for the 
manuscript TODO.

More specifically, the data used in this analysis is from:

- *Table S1.* RNA-sequencing analysis of control-treated or TGF-b-treated PSCs - differential expression analysis (related to Figure 1).
- *Table S2.* RNA-sequencing analysis of control-treated or CM-treated PSCs with or without ERBBi - differential expression analysis(related to Figures 2 and 3). 

### Code, Data, Results
All associated code is provided in the *code* directory.

The *data* directory contains all necessary data.

Output plots will be saved in the *results* directory.

### How to replicate analysis
All scripts can be executed using run.sh or directly using Rscript.
Necessary packages can be installed using install_xeva.R.
